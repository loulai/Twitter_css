Mock Twitter (Front-end)
===
**For now, this doesn't look like the real thing.**

The aim of this project is to create a page that looks nearly identical to Twitter. It is purely front-end; there is no real 'code' here.

I just gave it a go for half a day. But for now, I'm backing away. I might re-visit this later on.

'till another time, [Twitter].
